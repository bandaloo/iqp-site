        Because COVID-19 derailed just about everything across the entire globe
        (colleges, concerts, conventions, the Olympics) it is unsurprising that
        this global pandemic has made many of our previous plans difficult or
        impossible. However, we would still have all the tools we would need to
        redo the construction of the motor, and create an engaging website that
        documents our experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The part of our project that had to be put on hold indefinitely was any
        further attempt to permanently magnetize iron. All of our magnet-making
        attempts in C-term were performed in the Washburn shops. After our more
        period-accurate attempts failed, we were using an oxyacetylene torch in
        the welding room to heat our bar of iron up to the Curie temperature. As
        previously discussed, one of the problems with our setup was that the
        neodymium magnets we were using to create our external magnetic field
        would *also* reach the Curie temperature, therefore losing their
        magnetic properties in the process, turning our neodymium magnets into
        neodymium blocks of metal. We realized that if we were going to continue
        using magnets to create an external magnetic field, we were going to
        need to insulate our neodymium magnets, which would require a more
        involved rig. Sam has good experience in designing parts with CAD
        software and machining those parts out of aluminum stock. With the
        machine shop no longer at our disposal, this plan became infeasible.
      </p>

        Over spring break, we met at Sam's house multiple times to restore the
        woodworking of the motor from the previous IQP team. While we were
        productive during the times that we met, national stay-at-home orders
        put an end to our in person meetups. In order to adapt to these new
        restrictions on our abilities to collaborate, we split up the work
        accordingly: Sam would focus on finalizing the physical motor, and Cole
        would focus on putting together the custom website.
