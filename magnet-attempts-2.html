      <p>
        The main problems with trying to make a magnet in the coal fire were the
        long amount of time it took to heat up the metal and our inability to
        start the coal fire while we were on campus. Both of these problems lead
        to long turn around times between attempts causing us to only try making
        a magnet four times in the first term of the project. For the second
        term, we reached out to Ian Anderson a Senior Instructional Lab
        Technician at WPI to help streamline the process and run it on campus.
        In order to cut down the time to heat up the metal we decided to break
        our rule of not using modern technology during testing to speed up the
        process and then return to older technology once we had successfully
        created a magnet. The new technology we began using was the oxyacetylene
        torch to heat the metal. In addition, we were also given neodymium
        magnets to replace the solenoid as the source of the magnetic field. In
        our first attempt we were able to heat the metal up to a cherry red glow
        which we estimated to be around 1400 degrees fahrenheit. Then we applied
        the magnets to either end of the metal. Unfortunately there was a
        coating on the metal that vaporized and then caught on fire so we had to
        pull the magnets off before it got out of control. Additionally, we
        destroyed the epoxy coating on the magnets that we borrowed.

        After this attempt, we ordered our own magnets to do the experiment
        with. We ordered two strong neodymium magnets with dimensions 40 by 40
        by 20 millimeters. We used a larger nozzle for the torch compared to our
        previous attempt. This time, we placed the magnets on the bar while
        heating up the center with the torch, instead of attaching the magnets
        after the bar reached the correct temperature. The assumption we were
        making was that the heat from the torch would not conduct all the way to
        the ends of the bar, since we were applying heat in a concentrated
        manner at the center of the bar. However, we were wrong; the magnets
        attached to the end of the bars reached their Curie temperature while we
        were heating up the iron. Almost simultaneously, the neodymium magnets
        were rendered inert, and both of the magnets fell off of the bar. We
        purchased new magnets for future attempts, but we did not get a chance
        to try again before the pandemic made using the machine shop impossible.
        This was a stark reminder that the Curie temperature is a double-edged
        blade; while it can add magnetic properties to metal, it will also
        destroy all existing magnetic properties. It was clear that we needed a
        way to prevent our “source magnets” from reaching the same temperatures
        as our target iron.

        oxyacetylene torch.

        This video shows the result of applying the magnets coated with an epoxy
        directly onto the metal. We were told the epoxy was "un-meltable" but
        everything has its price! (Everything turned out alright.)
