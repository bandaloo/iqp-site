      <h2>Original Motor</h2>
      <p>
        The motor from the original IQP team was in a state of disrepair when we
        received it. Some of the repairs we had to make were strictly necessary
        in order to get the motor to a functioning state. Other repairs,
        however, were aesthetic. Since the motor is a demonstration tool, we
        felt it was important that the finished product be visually appealing.
        We also wanted to make the motor more durable and reliable than the
        previous team's motor.

      <h2>Cutting the Rings</h2>
      <p>
        There were many things we knew we could improve on from an aesthetic
        standpoint. The top ring of the original IQP team's motor was
        constructed out of two semicircular pieces of wood. This was an
        aesthetic problem as well as a structural problem, as the motor was
        beginning to fall apart where the two semicircular pieces of wood were
        joined together. To improve the design, we wanted to replace these two
        pieces of wood with a singular ring-shaped piece of wood. However, we
        needed a precise inner and outer radius in order to fit the existing
        semicircular electromagnets we had at our disposal. For the design of
        the motor, we needed to create two rings to stack on top of one another,
        with the bottom ring having a larger diameter. This configuration
        creates a circular shelf for the electromagnets to sit on top of.
      </p>
      <p>
        To accomplish this, we created a "router jig" in order to create a
        perfect arc with the router, which was much more precise than anything
        we could do by hand. We used a sacrificial particle board on top of a
        plank of pinewood so we could cut directly through the pinewood without
        damaging the workbench.
      </p>

      <p>
        We learned that moving the router slowly was important to creating a
        smooth finish on the edge of the wood. With the router jig, we were able
        to use the same process for the inner and outer circumfrences.

      <p>
        To improve on the aesthetics of the original IQP motor, we wanted to
        round the edges of the rings we cut. We did this by changing the
        drillbit on the router we used to create the ring shapes. We were very
        happy with the results!
