      <p>
        The dream of creating a powerful permanent magnet for our motor died
        unceremoniously with the implications of the growing global pandemic.
        However, we learned many lessons through trial-and-error which we hope
        to pass onto any future IQP team, or anyone attempting a similar
        project. We believe we were on the right track to make a working magnet
        in D term, but there were pitfalls that prevented us from doing so
        earlier.
      </p>
      <h2>Look at Historical Material</h2>
      <p>
        If you are looking to fashion your very own permanent magnet from a
        piece of iron, after a cursory Google, you'll find that magnet-making is
        not really a hobby. There are no strict how-to guides, and most
        information applies to how to create magnets with modern high-tech
        equipment. However, we found that there was a niche of experimenters in
        the 16th century (and even before!) that were devising a variety of
        methods to create artificial magnets. Some of these methods are more
        practical than others, but these historical sources were of greater use
        to us than any YouTube video out there, since, again, people do not seem
        to be home-brewing their own artificial magnets in the 21st century.
      </p>
      <h2>Take Modern "Shortcuts"</h2>
      <p>
        In our first term of attempts, we were focused on using methods that
        were close to what Thomas Davenport would have had in the early 19th
        century. In hindsight, we should have started with a "proof of concept"
        method of magnetizing iron with whatever means necessary, disregarding
        the fact that Thomas Davenport did not have an oxyacetylene torch. Even
        if you forgo the charcoal fire for a modern method of heating the metal,
        do not underestimate the task! There are still many variables to
        consider. If you are able to create a magnet in this way, then move
        forward by replacing parts of the methodology with more period-accurate
        technology.
      </p>
      <h2>Find Help</h2>
      <p>
        Doug Leonardi was a useful resource. He lent us materials that we were
        able to use for creating a magnet and gave us his opinion about our
        methodology. We should have made more of these contacts earlier in the
        process. WPI is a perfect place to start looking, so we encourage any
        future IQP team to reach out as much as possible, especially if the size
        of the team is only two.
      </p>
      <h2>Have a Fire Extinguisher Ready</h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps this tip doesn't belong in this post-mortem since we were mostly
        diligent about this, but we want to reiterate this for any future IQP
        team. If you're making a magnet, you are probably working with extreme
        heat that will melt or ignite most things that come close. Another note
        about the extreme heatâ€”remember that the Curie temperature works two
        ways. It can add magnetization to metal, or remove it entirely. If you
        are using permanent magnets to create a third permanent magnet, you will
        need to find some way to bring the target metal to the Curie temperature
        while insulating the existing permanent magnets so they do not reach the
        Curie temperature, lose all magnetic properties and become useless. Our
        plan was to design and machine an aluminum rig for this before our plans
        were cut short.
      </p>
      <h2>Make a Magnet or a Motor (Not Both)</h2>
      <p>
        Making a magnet, for us, proved to be difficult. We destroyed a
        non-negligible amount of material we purchased and assembled for the
        purpose of attempting to create a magnet, including other magnets.
        Perhaps a future IQP could focus solely on the history of creating
        artificial permanent magnets, instead of creating a magnet as a
        component of a greater assemblage, as we were doing. This would take
        away the pressure of creating a magnet of the correct strength and shape
        for the motor, and instead let the IQP team focus on achieving the best
        results that are possible within the time frame. Hopefully reading our
        blog will give this future IQP team a head start!
      </p>
      <h1>Making a Motor: Post-mortem</h1>
      <p>
        In the end, we were not able to get the final motor spinning with the
        original armature. This was a combination of a few factors that we
        narrowed down through careful testing.
      </p>
      <h2>Lack of Magnetic Field Strength</h2>
      <p>
        With the 13V, 12A power supply that we had at our disposal, we were had
        great difficulty getting the outer electromagnets to be particularly
        strong when connected in series and in parallel, since both
        configurations were tested. By contrast, when connected to the power
        supply individually, the magnets were much stronger. We considered
        hooking up the motor to a car battery, but we were warned against this
        by Sam's uncle Bruce Johnson, who has worked with motors in the past.
        Parts of the motor were heating up considerably just when connected to
        the original power supply. We did not want to risk undoing all of our
        work by melting all of the important components.
      </p>
      <h2>Gauge of the Wires</h2>
      <p>
        We re-wound the outer electromagnets with 18 gauge magnet wire. The
        motor from the original IQP team had wound these outer magnets with 16
        gauge wire, which is thicker. We believe that the diameter of the wire
        we chose to use was limiting the current. We would suggest that the next
        team experiment with a variety of gauges to determine what gives the
        strongest magnetic field. Thicker wire should allow the motor to be
        connected to a stronger power supply.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, we unwound our 18 gauge magnet wire and wound 16 gauge
        magnet wire to see if this would make a significant difference.
        Unfortunately, this did not correct the issue we were having with low
        magnetic field strength.
      </p>
      <h2>Brushes</h2>
      <p>
        One component that was in question was the state of the brushes. The
        original IQP team had not soldered on the brushes. Instead, they opted
        to wind uncoated copper wire around the brushes so they stayed in place
        and conducted electricity. Because we were dubious about this, we added
        additional soldering in order to improve our chances. We purchased
        slot-car brushes in order to replace the old ones. However, the ended up
        being to small to use. We also purchased a sheet of copper from which we
        cut out strips to create brushes. We replaced the single brush that had
        snapped from the original motor with this.
      </p>
      <h2>Shape of Outer Magnets</h2>
      <p>
        The issue with magnets is that their strength drastically falls off with
        distance. Because the outer magnets formed a less-than-perfect
        circumference for our motor, the distance from the armature varied. With
        a more consistent distance around the circumference, we might have been
        able to get the armature to pull towards the poles of the outer magnet.
        We were not able to get this behavior with our setup, likely due to the
        varying distance from the armature and the lack of field strength.
      </p>
      <h1>What We Learned</h1>
      <p>
        We learned many new techniques in woodworking and electrical engineering
        throughout the project. It was also interesting to dive into the history
        of electric motors and artificial magnets; this is something we likely
        would never have encountered if we did not undertake this project. One
        of the best parts about the project was that it gave us the opportunity
        to get our hands dirty, so to speak, allowing us to try out all of the
        things we read about with regard to motors and magnets. We encountered
        many unique problems, and although we didn't overcome them all, this
        alone was a valuable experience.
