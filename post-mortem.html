      <p>
        The dream of creating a powerful permanent magnet for our motor died
        unceremoniously with the implications of the growing global pandemic.
        However, we learned many lessons through trial-and-error which we hope
        to pass onto any future IQP team, or anyone attempting a similar
        project. We believe we were on the right track to make a working magnet
        in D term, but there were pitfalls that prevented us from doing so
        earlier.
      </p>
      <h2>Look at Historical Material</h2>
      <p>
        If you are looking to fashion your very own permanent magnet from a
        piece of iron, after a cursory Google, you'll find that magnet-making is
        not really a hobby. There are no strict how-to guides, and most
        information applies to how to create magnets with modern high-tech
        equipment. However, we found that there was a niche of experimenters in
        the 16th century (and even before!) that were devising a variety of
        methods to create artificial magnets. Some of these methods are more
        practical than others, but these historical sources were of greater use
        to us than any YouTube video out there, since, again, people do not seem
        to be home-brewing their own artificial magnets in the 21st century.
      </p>
      <h2>Take Modern "Shortcuts"</h2>
      <p>
        In our first term of attempts, we were focused on using methods that
        were close to what Thomas Davenport would have had in the early 19th
        century. In hindsight, we should have started with a "proof of concept"
        method of magnetizing iron with whatever means necessary, disregarding
        the fact that Thomas Davenport did not have an acetylene torch. Even if
        you forgo the charcoal fire for a modern method of heating the metal, do
        not underestimate the task! There are still many variables to consider.
        If you are able to create a magnet in this way, then move forward by
        replacing parts of the methodology with more period-accurate technology.
      </p>
      <h2>Find Help</h2>
      <p>
        Doug Leonardi was a useful resource. He lent us materials that we were
        able to use for creating a magnet and gave us his opinion about our
        methodology. We should have made more of these contacts earlier in the
        process. WPI is a perfect place to start looking, so we encourage any
        future IQP team to reach out as much as possible, especially if the size
        of the team is only two.
      </p>
      <h2>Have a Fire Extinguisher Ready</h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps this tip doesn't belong in this post-mortem since we were mostly
        diligent about this, but we want to reiterate this for any future IQP
        team. If you're making a magnet, you are probably working with extreme
        heat that will melt or ignite most things that come close. Another note
        about the extreme heatâ€”remember that the Curie temperature works two
        ways. It can add magnetization to metal, or remove it entirely. If you
        are using permanent magnets to create a third permanent magnet, you will
        need to find some way to bring the target metal to the Curie temperature
        while insulating the existing permanent magnets so they do not reach the
        Curie temperature, lose all magnetic properties and become useless. Our
        plan was to design and machine an aluminum rig for this before our plans
        were cut short.
      </p>
      <h2>Make a Magnet or a Motor (Not Both)</h2>
      <p>
        Making a magnet, for us, proved to be difficult. We destroyed a
        non-negligible amount of material we purchased and assembled for the
        purpose of attempting to create a magnet, including other magnets.
        Perhaps a future IQP could focus solely on the history of creating
        artificial permanent magnets, instead of creating a magnet as a
        component of a greater assemblage, as we were doing. This would take
        away the pressure of creating a magnet of the correct strength and shape
        for the motor, and instead let the IQP team focus on achieving the best
        results that are possible within the time frame. Hopefully reading our
        blog will give this future IQP team a head start!
