      <h2>Permanent Magnet History</h2>
      <p>
        The 1837 patent for Thomas Davenport's motor does not offer much help
        for how to produce two semicircular artificial magnets, as all the
        patent states is that
        <a
          href="https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091015161434/http://www.tecsoc.org/pubs/history/2002/feb25b.htm"
          >The artificial magnets S T are made of steel and in the usual
          manner</a
        >
        without saying what the usual manner is. The patent also states that
        galvanic (meaning electromagnetic) magnets, but we wanted to explore
        what it would take to use create artificial magnets instead. The reader
        would likely be surprised by how difficult it is to research the subject
        of the history of developing permanent magnets. The most helpful source
        that we found, titled "The Early History of The Permanent Magnet" by
        Edward Neville Da Costa Andrade, makes this observation as well. The
        paper mentions that little is known about how powerful these
        centuries-old artificial magnets were, or the precise methods for how
        these magnets were made. Even though "the history of magnetism has been
        but little explored" by the author's own admission, the details that are
        known are surprisingly practical. Most modern information about how to
        create a magnet requires expensive industrial equipment we (and Thomas
        Davenport) did not have access to. Ironically, the details from
        experiments on magnets performed centuries ago by people who did not
        fully understand electromagnetism were <i>more</i> practical to us than
        modern-day sources about manufacturing a magnet. However, some of these
        centuries-old sources contained literal superstition about how magnets
        functioned. Information such as the fact that garlic and goats' blood
        could sap magnetic power, were, of course, less practical.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most notable contributors to early permanent artificial
        magnet research was William Gilbert, who published
        <i
          >De Magnete Magneticisque Corporibus et de Magno Magnete Tellure
          Physiologia Nova</i
        >
        in 1600. This book is a rare book that costs more than a luxury car, and
        we could not find any translations online. Luckily for us, the paper
        summarizes the three methods that Gilbert outlines for creating
        permanent magnets. Furthermore, these three methods were the main
        methods for producing a permanent artificial magnet well into the 19th
        century (3).

      <ul>
        <li>
          1. Touching a load-stone to a piece of iron very gently, drawing it
          out from the middle
        </li>
        <li>2. Forging iron in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field</li>
        <li>
          3. While red-hot heat destroys magnetism, leaving a peice of iron to
          cool in the direction of Earth's magnetic field would acquire magnetic
          properties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Option 1 presupposes the existence of another magnet, and is best for
        creating compass needles. For our motor, we were going to need a much
        stronger magnet, so the load-stone touching method was not as
        interesting to us as the other two methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        We entertained option 2 for a short while, briefly looking at ways to
        create a backyard forge. However, we deemed that this wouldn't be
        entirely practical for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third option is interesting, because what Gilbert is observing is
        the Curie Temperature. Pierre Curie discovered and the laws that govern
        how magnetism relates to heat in 1895, centuries after Gilbert published
        his observations about magnetism and red-hot heat in 1600. This also
        reaffirmed that we were headed in the right direction with our previous
        attempts where we heated up iron and let it cool in the presence of a
        magnetic field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the 17th century, there were not many new methods being
        developed. Instead, these methods were refined and improved. However, in
        the 18th century, there were a few novel methods that were published.
        One such method was developed by Gowin Knight. (Interestingly, the
        method was developed in secret, and published after his death.) Instead
        of a normal bar of iron, he created a "sludge" of iron oxide powder by
        moving a tub of water and the powder back and forth for a long time. He
        then hardened the sludge with linseed oil and magnetized the resulting
        material using existing magnets. Apparently, this resulted in strong
        magnets (6). While this method was interesting to us since we were
        having trouble purchasing raw iron (we previously settled on low-carbon
        steel,) it was clear that this method was particularly involved.
      </p>
      <h2>New Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Since our previous attempts with a charcoal fire failed, we decided to
        focus less on being period-accurate with our experiments. Instead of
        using a charcoal fire, we opted to heat the metal with an acetylene
        torch to achieve temperatures to surpass the Curie Point. Similarly, we
        decided to replace the PVC pipe and magnet wire solenoid with a new
        setup that would also create an approximately uniform field. The
        solenoid setup we previously had was difficult to use and melted
        quickly. Instead of relying on the magnetic field of the earth, we
        purchased two powerful neodymium magnets for the purpose of supplying an
        external magnetic field. To replace the uniform field created on the
        inside of a solenoid, the neodymium magnets would act as two plates,
        which also approximates a uniform magnetic field.
