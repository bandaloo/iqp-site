      <h1>First Attempts at Creating a Magnet</h1>

      <br />

      <p>
        Our first attempts at creating a permanent magnet were largely
        achronistic, save for a few details in order to better our chances. The
        basic premise was to use charcoal heat up iron to the Curie temperature.
        The Curie temperature is the temperature at which a material loses all
        magnetic properties. However, it is also the temperature at which it is
        possible to add magnetic properties to that same material by inducing a
        magnetic field. Our plan was to induce this magnetic field by placing the
        iron inside a solenoid as it cooled. For iron, this is
        <a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/FeliciaLau.shtml"
          >around 770 °C.</a
        >. Charcoal burns at
        <a href="https://sciencing.com/hot-bonfire-8770.html"
          >at around 1100 °C</a
        >
        so achieving the Curie temperature of iron with this method is
        theoretically possible! Knowing this basic property, we bought the following
        materials:
        <ul>
          <li>An abundance of charcoal</li>
          <li>2 Low-carbon steel bars</li>
          <li>Rebar (for practicing before moving onto the iron bars)</li>
          <li>Magnet wire (for the solenoid)</li>
          <li>PVC pipe (also for the solenoid)</li>
        </ul>
        In addition to this, we had a few items already at our disposal:
        <ul>
          <li>Fire pit (for the charcoal fire)</li>
          <li>13 volt power supply (to power our solenoid)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
