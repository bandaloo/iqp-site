      <p>
        Our first attempts at creating a permanent magnet had fewer anachronisms
        compared to our later attempts, save for a few details in order to
        better our chances. The basic premise was to use charcoal heat up iron
        to the Curie temperature. The Curie temperature is the temperature at
        which a material loses all magnetic properties. However, it is also the
        temperature at which it is possible to add magnetic properties to that
        same material by inducing a magnetic field. Our plan was to induce this
        magnetic field by placing the iron inside a solenoid as it cooled. For
        iron, the Curie temperature
        <a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/FeliciaLau.shtml"
          >around 770 degrees Celsius.</a
        >. Charcoal burns at
        <a href="https://sciencing.com/hot-bonfire-8770.html"
          >at around 1100 degrees Celsius</a
        >
        so achieving the Curie temperature of iron with this method is
        theoretically possible! Hammering on the metal as it cools
        <a href="https://sciencing.com/magnetize-things-6377.html"
          >also helps the atoms realign to the magnetic field of the
          environment.</a
        >
      </p>
      <h2>Materials</h2>
      <p>
        Knowing this basic property of heating iron to its Curie temperature to
        induce permanent magnetization, we bought the following materials:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An abundance of charcoal</li>
        <li>2 Low-carbon steel bars</li>
        <li>Rebar (for practicing before moving onto the iron bars)</li>
        <li>Magnet wire (for the solenoid)</li>
        <li>PVC pipe (also for the solenoid)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to this, we had a few items already at our disposal:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fire pit (for the charcoal fire)</li>
        <li>13 volt power supply (to power our solenoid)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Method for Reaching Curie Temperature</h2>
      <p>
        TODO: talk about what we were looking for visually that indicated that
        the flames were hot enough. Talk about the methods we used for giving
        the fire oxygen (blowing into it with those tubes and fanning it with
        that big piece of plastic.) Maybe talk about that YouTube video about
        making charcoal fires. Maybe mention the gasoline. We can have the video
        of you starting the fire here.
      </p>

      <h2>Method for Magnetization</h2>
      <p>
        After we thought we had heated up our piece of metal to the Curie
        temperature, the next step was to let the metal cool in a magnetic
        field. While the Earth's magnetic field is, of course, readily
        available, we wanted to improve our chances of success by creating a
        stronger, induced magnetic field using a solenoid. A solenoid that is
        long enough approximates a
        <a
          href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/solenoid.html"
          >nearly uniform electromagnetic field</a
        >
        in the center. We built our solenoid out of a segment of PVC pipe and
        magnet wire.
      </p>
      <img
        class="blogimage"
        src="images/solenoid.jpg"
        alt="Solenoid we used for magnetizing our first attempts"
      />
      <p>
        We ran a 13 volt current through our solenoid using a power supply we
        had on hand. We were surprised by just how strong of a magnetic field
        our solenoid induced!
      </p>
      <img
        class="blogimage"
        src="images/power-supply.jpg"
        alt="Power supply for running current through the solenoid"
      />
      <p>
        Since our plan was to let the metal cool inside the solenoid after
        reaching the Curie temperature, we had concerns about keeping the hot
        metal stable inside the magnetic field. PVC pipe melts at
        <a
          href="https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-pvc-plastic"
          >around 260 degrees Celsius</a
        >
        depending on the makeup of the plastic. In order to prevent our plastic
        solenoid from melting too quickly, we planned accordingly. One of us
        would hold the solenoid vertically on top of an anvil, while keeping the
        heated metal at the center of the solenoid. This would be done with the
        aid of heat-resistant gloves and a large adjustable wrench. The
        solenoid, being magnetized, would pull the metal away from the center
        and toward the edge, so this was an important task. While one person
        kept the pieces of our magnetization rig fixed in place, the other would
        use a hammer to repeatedly strike the magnet as it was cooling. Then, we
        would leave the metal resting on a bed of bricks until it was cool
        enough to handle.
      </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>

      <p>
        We attempted this process four times over the course of two separate
        days. The first two attempts were performed with short sections of rebar
        before moving onto the more expensive bars of low carbon steel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first attempt with the rebar was more successful than our second
        attempt. We were able to hammer the hot metal inside the magnetic field
        created by the solenoid for a longer period of time. However, by our
        second attempt, the solenoid was already beginning to wear from the heat
        radiating off of the metal. We had to abort our second attempt
        prematurely; the entire solenoid started to bend as the PVC piping lost
        its structural integrity. Because we destroyed our first solenoid, we
        had to wind a new one for our future attempts. We let the metal cool
        overnight. After some testing, it was clear that neither piece of rebar
        gained any magnetic properties from this process.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the issues with rebar is that it is very difficult to discern
        exactly what a singular piece is made of, since
        <a
          href="https://www.concreteconstruction.net/how-to/materials/from-old-cars-comes-rebar_o"
          >it comes from crushed old cars and appliances.</a
        >
        Therefore, we did not know precisely how ferrous the material we were
        working with actually was. Because of this, we had higher hopes for our
        low carbon steel, which we purchased from McMaster-Carr. We repeated our
        process with the higher-quality material. During our final attempt, the
        thin layer of transparent insulation on the magnet wire melted, shorting
        the circuit, sending off sparks. Neither of these attempts resulted in
        permanently (or even temporarily) magnetized metal, either.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many factors that could have prevented us from magnetizing the
        metal using our process. It is possible that we were not reaching
        high-enough temperatures with the charcoal fire. We attempted to gauge
        the temperature of the metal by using a color chart, which might not
        have been entirely accurate. Also, we were limited in how long we were
        able to keep the hot metal inside the solenoid due to the instability of
        our setup; it is possible that we needed to do this for longer.
