        Thomas Davenport was an inventor from Williamstown, Vermont. Despite his
        significant engineering achievement, Davenport comes from humble
        beginnings. He is the son of Daniel Davenport and Hannah Rice, and was
        one of their twelve children [5]! He only had three years of formal
        schooling [1]. At the age of 14, he became an apprentice to a blacksmith
        [3].

        Thomas Davenport became captivated by the potential of electromagnetism
        in 1831 [4] when he visited Penfield Iron Works in Crown point, NY,
        which was a hamlet of Ironville [3]. There, he observed an electromagnet
        that was used for separating iron ore [2]. This magnet, created by
        Joseph Henry, could lift 750 points of iron. In 1833, he dipped into his
        savings (and sold his brother's horse) in order to purchase one of
        Joseph Henry's magnets so he could take it apart and begin studying
        electromagnetism [3].
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world where many bright minds were performing similar experiments
        with electromagnetism, Thomas Davenport's novel invention was
        discovering that a brush and commutator could be used to reverse the
        electromagnet's polarity, so the motor could complete a full turn
        instead of just a half turn. By 1834, he completed his motor and
        demonstrated it to a professor in Middlebury College in Middlebury,
        Vermont. In 1835, in Springfield, Massachusetts, he showed his invention
        to the public

        Unfortunately, Thomas Davenport did not find much success with his
        invention during his lifetime. He died at the young age of 48 [4]. Since
        he had difficult finding financial backing for his invention, he instead
        created a journal about electromagnetism and mechanics, whose printing
        press was powered by his invention [4]. In 1910, decades after his
        death, Thomas Davenport got some semblance of the respect he deserved.
        The National Electric Lights Association gave him a level of respect by
        unveiling a stone tablet in recognition of Thomas Davenport's
        achievements; there were 500 in attendance, and the ceremony was even
        complete with a brass band [2]. In volume 56 of Electric World, this was
        published about his legacy:
      </p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
        "Seen from the industrial standpoint it is significant that if the
        Davenport patent were enforced today it would embrace every one of the
        millions of electric motors in use in the United States, whose royalties
        would constitute an income equal to anything enjoyed by Carnegie or
        Rockefeller. It would have been a merciful dispensation if the bitter
        bread of struggle and disaster eaten all the years of his short life by
        this extraordinary, this prophetic village blacksmith, could have been
        sweetened with the merest modicum of the vast wealth that his glowing
        conceptions have helped to create for the benefit of all" [6].
